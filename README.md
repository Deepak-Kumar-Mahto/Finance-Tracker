These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
    cd my-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies for both the client and the server:

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies for the client
    cd client
    npm install
    
    # Install dependencies for the server
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Client

The client side of the project is built with React.js.

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the React app in action.

## Running the Server

The server side of the project is built with Node.js and Express.

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Start the Node.js server:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

3. The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.
